# A Next JS (React) web application for Weather Forecast
<h2>Project Demo site: https://celestial-cast.vercel.app/</h2>

A Next JS app which leverages open-weather-API using AXIOS to make the API call. Once the GET request returns a succesful JSON object, it is de-structured and processed in weather component and styled using tailwind css. A simple but highly effective application.
